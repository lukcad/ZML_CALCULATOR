# ZML_CALCULATOR
RAP calculator app using `side effects`. This is implementation from Mikhail after reading this great blog post [How to use side effects in RAP](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/23/how-to-use-side-effects-in-rap/)

if you use latest version `SAP ABAP RAP` on your server or cloud SAP instance which includes `side effects` functionality you may wish understood how it is helpful for customer.

Working wiht this calculator in edit mode (ususally you create new record of your calculations) you are able to see how the result will be changed after modification 3 fields:

* OperandA
* OperandB
* Operator

So it is really useful to see changes before those will be saved. 

Have a fun!

Thank you, Mikhail.
